# SmartContractProject

This code is a simple deposit and withdrawal system with the following statements: `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()`.

## Statements
- The `require()` statement will check whether the condition is true or not and will proceed depending on code logic.
- The `assert()` statement should always return true as this prevents the wallet from overflowing.
- The `revert()` statement will try to revert the transaction if the condition in it returns true.
